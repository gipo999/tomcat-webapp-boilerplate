# NOTE: initially a multi stage build was used, but it was removed to allow for caching of gradle dependencies
# Building a war inside the container downloads and reinstalls gradle and all dependencies every single time and it takes an absurd amount of time (4+ minutes added to every run).
# I will leave it here for reference but the CI actions build in baremetal and copy the outputs inside.
