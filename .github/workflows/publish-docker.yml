    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency
    # concurrency can be used to limit the number of jobs running at the same time for the whole repo
    # to prevent using too many resources when too many PRs are opened or commits pushed
    # For example, the ability to run workflows concurrently means that if multiple commits are pushed to a repository in quick succession, each push could trigger a separate workflow run, and these runs will execute concurrently.
    #
    # use case: for example, when someone pushes a commit to a PR, the workflow will be triggered again
    # we want to cancel previous jobs and only run the latest one
    concurrency:
      # at most there will be 1 job running at the same time for the whole repo
      # and 1 pending job
      # previous pending jobs will be cancelled if a new one is triggered
      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
      # we can use cancel-in-progress to cancel the previous job if a new one is triggered
      # cancel-in-progress: true
