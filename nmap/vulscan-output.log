| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2007-4654] Unspecified vulnerability in SSHield 1.6.1 with OpenSSH 3.0.2p1 on Cisco WebNS 8.20.0.1 on Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS) series 11000 devices allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion and device crash) via a series of large packets designed to exploit the SSH CRC32 attack detection overflow (CVE-2001-0144), possibly a related issue to CVE-2002-1024.
| [CVE-1999-0661] A system is running a version of software that was replaced with a Trojan Horse at one of its distribution points, such as (1) TCP Wrappers 7.6, (2) util-linux 2.9g, (3) wuarchive ftpd (wuftpd) 2.2 and 2.1f, (4) IRC client (ircII) ircII 2.2.9, (5) OpenSSH 3.4p1, or (6) Sendmail 8.12.6.

| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-2071] java/org/apache/catalina/core/AsyncContextImpl.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40 does not properly handle the throwing of a RuntimeException in an AsyncListener in an application, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive request information intended for other applications in opportunistic circumstances via an application that records the requests that it processes.
| [CVE-2013-2067] java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/FormAuthenticator.java in the form authentication feature in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 through 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.33 does not properly handle the relationships between authentication requirements and sessions, which allows remote attackers to inject a request into a session by sending this request during completion of the login form, a variant of a session fixation attack.
| [CVE-2013-1088] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Novell iManager 2.7 before SP6 Patch 1 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging improper request validation by iManager code deployed within an Apache Tomcat container.
| [CVE-2012-5887] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 does not properly check for stale nonce values in conjunction with enforcement of proper credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests.
| [CVE-2012-5886] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 caches information about the authenticated user within the session state, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication via vectors related to the session ID.
| [CVE-2012-5885] The replay-countermeasure functionality in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 tracks cnonce (aka client nonce) values instead of nonce (aka server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count) values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
| [CVE-2012-5568] Apache Tomcat through 7.0.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via partial HTTP requests, as demonstrated by Slowloris.
| [CVE-2012-4534] org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.28, when the NIO connector is used in conjunction with sendfile and HTTPS, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by terminating the connection during the reading of a response.

| [CVE-2012-3908] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the ISE Administrator user interface (aka the Apache Tomcat interface) on Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) 3300 series appliances before 1.1.0.665 Cumulative Patch 1 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators, aka Bug ID CSCty46684.
| [CVE-2012-3546] org/apache/catalina/realm/RealmBase.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.30, when FORM authentication is used, allows remote attackers to bypass security-constraint checks by leveraging a previous setUserPrincipal call and then placing /j_security_check at the end of a URI.
| [CVE-2012-3544] Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.37 and 7.x before 7.0.30 does not properly handle chunk extensions in chunked transfer coding, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data.
| [CVE-2012-3126] Unspecified vulnerability in the Solaris Cluster component in Oracle Sun Products Suite 3.3 allows local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Apache Tomcat Agent.
| [CVE-2012-2733] java/org/apache/coyote/http11/InternalNioInputBuffer.java in the HTTP NIO connector in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.28 does not properly restrict the request-header size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large amount of header data.
| [CVE-2012-0022] Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.34, and 7.x before 7.0.23 uses an inefficient approach for handling parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a request that contains many parameters and parameter values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4858.
| [CVE-2011-5064] DigestAuthenticator.java in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 uses Catalina as the hard-coded server secret (aka private key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
| [CVE-2011-5063] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check realm values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the availability of a protection space with weaker authentication or authorization requirements, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
| [CVE-2011-5062] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check qop values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended integrity-protection requirements via a qop=auth value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
| [CVE-2011-4858] Apache Tomcat before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.35, and 7.x before 7.0.23 computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.
| [CVE-2011-3376] org/apache/catalina/core/DefaultInstanceManager.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.22 does not properly restrict ContainerServlets in the Manager application, which allows local users to gain privileges by using an untrusted web application to access the Manager application's functionality.
| [CVE-2011-3375] Apache Tomcat 6.0.30 through 6.0.33 and 7.x before 7.0.22 does not properly perform certain caching and recycling operations involving request objects, which allows remote attackers to obtain unintended read access to IP address and HTTP header information in opportunistic circumstances by reading TCP data.
| [CVE-2011-3190] Certain AJP protocol connector implementations in Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.20, 6.0.0 through 6.0.33, 5.5.0 through 5.5.33, and possibly other versions allow remote attackers to spoof AJP requests, bypass authentication, and obtain sensitive information by causing the connector to interpret a request body as a new request.
| [CVE-2011-2729] native/unix/native/jsvc-unix.c in jsvc in the Daemon component 1.0.3 through 1.0.6 in Apache Commons, as used in Apache Tomcat 5.5.32 through 5.5.33, 6.0.30 through 6.0.32, and 7.0.x before 7.0.20 on Linux, does not drop capabilities, which allows remote attackers to bypass read permissions for files via a request to an application.
| [CVE-2011-2526] Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.19, when sendfile is enabled for the HTTP APR or HTTP NIO connector, does not validate certain request attributes, which allows local users to bypass intended file access restrictions or cause a denial of service (infinite loop or JVM crash) by leveraging an untrusted web application.
| [CVE-2011-2481] Apache Tomcat 7.0.x before 7.0.17 permits web applications to replace an XML parser used for other web applications, which allows local users to read or modify the (1) web.xml, (2) context.xml, or (3) tld files of arbitrary web applications via a crafted application that is loaded earlier than the target application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2009-0783 regression.
| [CVE-2011-2204] Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.17, when the MemoryUserDatabase is used, creates log entries containing passwords upon encountering errors in JMX user creation, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading a log file.
| [CVE-2011-1582] Apache Tomcat 7.0.12 and 7.0.13 processes the first request to a servlet without following security constraints that have been configured through annotations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1088, CVE-2011-1183, and CVE-2011-1419.

| [CVE-2011-1502] Liferay Portal Community Edition (CE) 6.x before 6.0.6 GA, when Apache Tomcat is used, allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via an entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (aka XXE) issue.
| [CVE-2011-1475] The HTTP BIO connector in Apache Tomcat 7.0.x before 7.0.12 does not properly handle HTTP pipelining, which allows remote attackers to read responses intended for other clients in opportunistic circumstances by examining the application data in HTTP packets, related to "a mix-up of responses for requests from different users."
| [CVE-2011-1419] Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.11, when web.xml has no security constraints, does not follow ServletSecurity annotations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests to a web application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1088.
| [CVE-2011-1184] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not have the expected countermeasures against replay attacks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests, related to lack of checking of nonce (aka server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count or client nonce count) values.
| [CVE-2011-1183] Apache Tomcat 7.0.11, when web.xml has no login configuration, does not follow security constraints, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests to a meta-data complete web application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-1088 and CVE-2011-1419.
| [CVE-2011-1088] Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.10 does not follow ServletSecurity annotations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests to a web application.
| [CVE-2011-0534] Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.6 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.30 does not enforce the maxHttpHeaderSize limit for requests involving the NIO HTTP connector, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OutOfMemoryError) via a crafted request.
| [CVE-2011-0013] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the HTML Manager Interface in Apache Tomcat 5.5 before 5.5.32, 6.0 before 6.0.30, and 7.0 before 7.0.6 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, as demonstrated via the display-name tag.
| [CVE-2010-4312] The default configuration of Apache Tomcat 6.x does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack a session via script access to a cookie.
| [CVE-2010-4172] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Manager application in Apache Tomcat 6.0.12 through 6.0.29 and 7.0.0 through 7.0.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) orderBy or (2) sort parameter to sessionsList.jsp, or unspecified input to (3) sessionDetail.jsp or (4) java/org/apache/catalina/manager/JspHelper.java, related to use of untrusted web applications.
| [CVE-2010-3718] Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.3, 6.0.x, and 5.5.x, when running within a SecurityManager, does not make the ServletContext attribute read-only, which allows local web applications to read or write files outside of the intended working directory, as demonstrated using a directory traversal attack.
| [CVE-2010-2227] Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.29, 6.0.0 through 6.0.27, and 7.0.0 beta does not properly handle an invalid Transfer-Encoding header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application outage) or obtain sensitive information via a crafted header that interferes with "recycling of a buffer."
| [CVE-2010-1157] Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.29 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.26 might allow remote attackers to discover the server's hostname or IP address by sending a request for a resource that requires (1) BASIC or (2) DIGEST authentication, and then reading the realm field in the WWW-Authenticate header in the reply.
| [CVE-2009-5120] The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 allows connections to TCP port 1812 from arbitrary source IP addresses, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via UTF-7 text to the 404 error page of a Project Woodstock service on this port.
| [CVE-2009-5119] The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 enables weak SSL ciphers in conf/server.xml, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network and then conducting a brute-force attack against encrypted session data.
| [CVE-2009-3843] HP Operations Manager 8.10 on Windows contains a "hidden account" in the XML file that specifies Tomcat users, which allows remote attackers to conduct unrestricted file upload attacks, and thereby execute arbitrary code, by using the org.apache.catalina.manager.HTMLManagerServlet class to make requests to manager/html/upload.
| [CVE-2009-3548] The Windows installer for Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 through 6.0.20, 5.5.0 through 5.5.28, and possibly earlier versions uses a blank default password for the administrative user, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2009-2902] Directory traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.28 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.20 allows remote attackers to delete work-directory files via directory traversal sequences in a WAR filename, as demonstrated by the ...war filename.
| [CVE-2009-2901] The autodeployment process in Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.28 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.20, when autoDeploy is enabled, deploys appBase files that remain from a failed undeploy, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended authentication requirements via HTTP requests.
| [CVE-2009-2696] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jsp/cal/cal2.jsp in the calendar application in the examples web application in Apache Tomcat on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Desktop Workstation 5, and Linux Desktop 5 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the time parameter, related to "invalid HTML." NOTE: this is due to a missing fix for CVE-2009-0781.

| [CVE-2001-1072] Apache with mod_rewrite enabled on most UNIX systems allows remote attackers to bypass RewriteRules by inserting extra / (slash) characters into the requested path, which causes the regular expression in the RewriteRule to fail.
| [CVE-2001-1013] Apache on Red Hat Linux with with the UserDir directive enabled generates different error codes when a username exists and there is no public_html directory and when the username does not exist, which could allow remote attackers to determine valid usernames on the server.
| [CVE-2001-0925] The default installation of Apache before 1.3.19 allows remote attackers to list directories instead of the multiview index.html file via an HTTP request for a path that contains many / (slash) characters, which causes the path to be mishandled by (1) mod_negotiation, (2) mod_dir, or (3) mod_autoindex.
| [CVE-2001-0917] Jakarta Tomcat 4.0.1 allows remote attackers to reveal physical path information by requesting a long URL with a .JSP extension.
| [CVE-2001-0766] Apache on MacOS X Client 10.0.3 with the HFS+ file system allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions via a URL that contains some characters whose case is not matched by Apache's filters.
| [CVE-2001-0731] Apache 1.3.20 with Multiviews enabled allows remote attackers to view directory contents and bypass the index page via a URL containing the "M=D" query string.
| [CVE-2001-0730] split-logfile in Apache 1.3.20 allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files that end in the .log extension via an HTTP request with a / (slash) in the Host: header.

| [CVE-2001-0131] htpasswd and htdigest in Apache 2.0a9, 1.3.14, and others allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2001-0108] PHP Apache module 4.0.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass .htaccess access restrictions via a malformed HTTP request on an unrestricted page that causes PHP to use those access controls on the next page that is requested.
| [CVE-2001-0042] PHP 3.x (PHP3) on Apache 1.3.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a modified .. (dot dot) attack containing "%5c" (encoded backslash) sequences.
| [CVE-2000-1247] The default configuration of the jserv-status handler in jserv.conf in Apache JServ 1.1.2 includes an "allow from 127.0.0.1" line, which allows local users to discover JDBC passwords or other sensitive information via a direct request to the jserv/ URI.
| [CVE-2000-1206] Vulnerability in Apache httpd before 1.3.11, when configured for mass virtual hosting using mod_rewrite, or mod_vhost_alias in Apache 1.3.9, allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files.
| [CVE-2000-1205] Cross site scripting vulnerabilities in Apache 1.3.0 through 1.3.11 allow remote attackers to execute script as other web site visitors via (1) the printenv CGI (printenv.pl), which does not encode its output, (2) pages generated by the ap_send_error_response function such as a default 404, which does not add an explicit charset, or (3) various messages that are generated by certain Apache modules or core code.  NOTE: the printenv issue might still exist for web browsers that can render text/plain content types as HTML, such as Internet Explorer, but CVE regards this as a design limitation of those browsers, not Apache.  The printenv.pl/acuparam vector, discloser on 20070724, is one such variant.
| [CVE-2000-1204] Vulnerability in the mod_vhost_alias virtual hosting module for Apache 1.3.9, 1.3.11 and 1.3.12 allows remote attackers to obtain the source code for CGI programs if the cgi-bin directory is under the document root.
| [CVE-2000-1168] IBM HTTP Server 1.3.6 (based on Apache) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary commands via a long GET request.
| [CVE-2000-1016] The default configuration of Apache (httpd.conf) on SuSE 6.4 includes an alias for the /usr/doc directory, which allows remote attackers to read package documentation and obtain system configuration information via an HTTP request for the /doc/packages URL.
| [CVE-2000-0913] mod_rewrite in Apache 1.3.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files if a RewriteRule directive is expanded to include a filename whose name contains a regular expression.
| [CVE-2000-0883] The default configuration of mod_perl for Apache as installed on Mandrake Linux 6.1 through 7.1 sets the /perl/ directory to be browseable, which allows remote attackers to list the contents of that directory.
| [CVE-2000-0869] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 enables WebDAV, which allows remote attackers to list arbitrary diretories via the PROPFIND HTTP request method.
| [CVE-2000-0868] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 allows remote attackers to read source code for CGI scripts by replacing the /cgi-bin/ in the requested URL with /cgi-bin-sdb/.
| [CVE-2000-0791] Trustix installs the httpsd program for Apache-SSL with world-writeable permissions, which allows local users to replace it with a Trojan horse.
| [CVE-2000-0672] The default configuration of Jakarta Tomcat does not restrict access to the /admin context, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by directly calling the administrative servlets to add a context for the root directory.
| [CVE-2000-0628] The source.asp example script in the Apache ASP module Apache::ASP 1.93 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify files.
| [CVE-2000-0505] The Apache 1.3.x HTTP server for Windows platforms allows remote attackers to list directory contents by requesting a URL containing a large number of / characters.
| [CVE-1999-1412] A possible interaction between Apple MacOS X release 1.0 and Apache HTTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a flood of HTTP GET requests to CGI programs, which generates a large number of processes.
| [CVE-1999-1293] mod_proxy in Apache 1.2.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via malformed FTP commands, which causes Apache to dump core.
| [CVE-1999-1237] Multiple buffer overflows in smbvalid/smbval SMB authentication library, as used in Apache::AuthenSmb and possibly other modules, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via (1) a long username, (2) a long password, and (3) other unspecified methods.
| [CVE-1999-1199] Apache WWW server 1.3.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a large number of MIME headers with the same name, aka the "sioux" vulnerability.
| [CVE-1999-1053] guestbook.pl cleanses user-inserted SSI commands by removing text between "<!--" and "-->" separators, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands when guestbook.pl is run on Apache 1.3.9 and possibly other versions, since Apache allows other closing sequences besides "-->".
| [CVE-1999-0926] Apache allows remote attackers to conduct a denial of service via a large number of MIME headers.
| [CVE-1999-0678] A default configuration of Apache on Debian GNU/Linux sets the ServerRoot to /usr/doc, which allows remote users to read documentation files for the entire server.
| [CVE-1999-0448] IIS 4.0 and Apache log HTTP request methods, regardless of how long they are, allowing a remote attacker to hide the URL they really request.
| [CVE-1999-0289] The Apache web server for Win32 may provide access to restricted files when a . (dot) is appended to a requested URL.
| [CVE-1999-0236] ScriptAlias directory in NCSA and Apache httpd allowed attackers to read CGI programs.
| [CVE-1999-0107] Buffer overflow in Apache 1.2.5 and earlier allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service with a large number of GET requests containing a large number of / characters.
| [CVE-1999-0071] Apache httpd cookie buffer overflow for versions 1.1.1 and earlier.
